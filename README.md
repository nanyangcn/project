# DevOps with Kubernetes

### DBaaS vs DIY [[1]](https://www.objectrocket.com/blog/company/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-dbaas/)

#### Advantages of DBaaS

* Don’t have to buy your own equipment or software licenses
* Don’t have to hire database developers
* Don’t have to build a database system
* Don’t have to hire a large IT crew to maintain the system
* Don’t pay the power bill for running all the servers
* A DBaaS often comes with uptime guarantees
* DBaaS teams are experienced, and know how to handle a variety of bugs and problems
* The database is off site, meaning loss of power or natural disaster at your business doesn’t affect it
* The DBaaS can usually devote more resources to their equipment, thus buying better servers and hardware than most small businesses can afford

#### Disadvantages of DBaaS

* Don’t have direct access to the servers that are running your database.
* Don’t have direct influence over the physical safety of those servers, or the cyber security that protects sensitive data.
* If DBaaS system goes down, don’t have access to your database.
* Once a business reaches a certain size, it becomes more economical to build their own database and run it themselves (like Google does).

### Why I choose DIY database ?

Because I want to be familiar with the procedure of how to set up a PostgreSQL database by myself.
